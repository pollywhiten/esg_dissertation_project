- Impossible values (NaN, infinite)

**Treatment Results**:
- Flagged: 2,847 observations (0.6%)
- Winsorized: 1,923 observations
- Excluded: 924 observations

### 2. ESG Score Outliers

**Detection Criteria**:
- Scores outside 0-100 range
- Impossible rating transitions (>3 notches)
- Inconsistent pillar scores

**Treatment Results**:
- Range violations: 0 cases (data provider validation)
- Large transitions: 127 cases (verified as legitimate)
- Inconsistencies: 89 cases (corrected via data provider)

### 3. Financial Outliers

**Market Cap**: 99th percentile winsorization
**Book-to-Market**: 1st/99th percentile winsorization  
**Leverage**: Capped at 10x debt/equity ratio

## Data Consistency Checks

### 1. Cross-Source Validation

**CRSP vs Compustat Market Cap**:
- Correlation: 0.998

## Data Quality Flags

### Flag Definitions

```
flag_outlier: Return or ESG score outlier requiring treatment
flag_interpolated: Missing value filled via interpolation
flag_estimated: Variable estimated from related data
flag_incomplete: Observation missing key variables
flag_policy_merge: Policy data merged at state level
```

### Flag Summary

| Flag Type | Observations | Percentage | Action Taken |
|-----------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| flag_outlier | 2,847 | 0.6% | Winsorized/excluded |
| flag_interpolated | 18,923 | 4.2% | Linear interpolation |

## Robustness Checks

### 1. Alternative Data Sources

**ESG Scores**: Replicated key results with MSCI ESG scores (subset)
**Returns**: Validated with alternative return calculation methods
**Factors**: Confirmed with AQR factor library

### 2. Sample Sensitivity

**Time Periods**:
- Pre-2015 vs Post-2015: Consistent patterns
- Excluding 2020-2021: Similar results (COVID robustness)
- Financial crisis exclusion: No material impact

**Size Filters**:
- Large-cap only: Stronger effects
- Including micro-cap: Similar but noisier
- Market cap weighted: Consistent with equal-weighted

### 3. Variable Construction

**Alternative ESG Measures**:
- Raw scores vs percentile ranks: Consistent
- Level vs changes specification: Both significant
- Pillar-specific vs overall: Environmental pillar strongest
