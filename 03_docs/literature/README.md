## Key Contributions to Literature

### 1. Novel Aspects
- Extended sample period (2010-2024 vs prior 2009-2020 studies)
- Policy interaction effects at state level
- High-frequency ESG rating change analysis
- Comprehensive robustness testing framework

### 2. Methodological Advances
- Improved ESG rating change detection
- State-level policy coding methodology
- Enhanced control group construction
- Multiple factor model specifications

### 3. Empirical Contributions
- Stronger ESG effects in policy-supportive states
- Heterogeneous effects by ESG pillar and firm size
- Long-term performance implications
- Policy regime interaction mechanisms

## Gap Analysis and Positioning

### Literature Gaps Addressed
1. **Limited policy interaction analysis** - Few studies examine how regulation moderates ESG effects
2. **Short sample periods** - Most studies end before 2020, missing recent ESG mainstream adoption
3. **Inconsistent methodology** - Lack of standardized approaches for ESG event studies
4. **US-centric analysis needed** - International studies dominate, less US state-level analysis

### Positioning Relative to Key Papers

**vs. Krüger (2015)**:
- Extended time period and sample size
- Added policy interaction dimension
- Enhanced statistical methodology

**vs. Flammer (2013)**:
- Broader ESG scope (beyond environmental)
- State-level heterogeneity analysis
- Modern ESG rating methodology

**vs. Avramov et al. (2022)**:
- Event study vs portfolio approach
- Policy moderation effects
- Longer post-event windows
